# Portfolio


## Description
 ðŸ’¡ The purpose of this project is to create a space to showcase future work and also tell a little about myself (the author) so that friends, family, prospective employers/clients, or collaborators can get a feel for my web developer experience.  Not only does this portfolio page display examples of my work, but the page itself also demonstrates my coding ability.

ðŸ’› I enjoyed creating this portfolio because it gave me an opportunity to experiment with styling and really practice the art of positioning and responsive web design.  Also, I had fun adding my personal creative flare to the page by incorporating my own images and photography.

âœ¨ I look forward to adding new functionality, creative elements, and portfolio items to this page in the future as my skills progress.  Stay tuned!
